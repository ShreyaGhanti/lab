//2â€¦ In this example, you have a base class Teacher and a sub class ITTeacher. Since
//class ITTeacher extends the designation and college properties and work () method from
//base class, we need not to declare these properties and method in sub class.
//Here we have college Name, designation and work () method which are common to all the
//teachers so we have declared them in the base class, this way the child classes like Math
//Teacher, Music Teacher and PhysicsTeacher do not need to write this code and can be used
//directly from base class.
class Teacher {
	String designation = "Teacher";
	String collegeName = "ABC";
	void does(){
